# robot_control
I did this project to control the base of the robot required for the Smart way project where I was able to learn how to start building a robot and how to operate and control it,
as the arm control page with the base control were combined on one page.
 I used html, javascript and ccs and to connect it 
 to a database it is necessary to use php and mysql 
 You can preview the control interface in HTML and you can see the desired result from the work of the codes The codes are written in notepad++ editor.
